# Hyalign tests

Hyalign comes with a few automated tests to help with development and spotting bugs.

To run the tests, execute this command from Hyalign's root directory:
```
pytest
```

Or if you have [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) installed, you can run the tests through it to get some code coverage stats:
```
coverage run -m pytest && coverage report -m hyalign/*.py
```
